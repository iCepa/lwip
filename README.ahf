- Remember to filter out pbuf allocations while profiling, otherwise things
  seems very confusing when we also look at Tor memory usage.
- The IP socket layer seems not needed in tun2tor, but the hooks that Conrad
  used in the patched lwip code seems to need it? This is confusing.

Memory:

1. Some static buffers seems to be never touched even when we run for a while?
Maybe we can disable those.
